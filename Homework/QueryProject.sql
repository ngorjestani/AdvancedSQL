-- 1. Create a query that displays the total dollar amount of sales before tax/freight for each month and year (ie, Jan 2020, Feb 2020, etc). Months should sort in calendar order.
with SalesByMonth as
(
select format(soh.OrderDate, 'MMM yyyy') as MonthYear, month(soh.OrderDate) Month, year(soh.OrderDate) Year, sum(soh.SubTotal) as MonthlySales
from Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
group by format(soh.OrderDate, 'MMM yyyy'), month(soh.OrderDate), year(soh.OrderDate)
)

-- ****************** Main Query *******************

select SalesByMonth.MonthYear, format(SalesByMonth.MonthlySales, 'c') MonthlySales
from SalesByMonth
group by SalesByMonth.MonthYear, SalesByMonth.MonthlySales, SalesByMonth.Year, SalesByMonth.Month
order by SalesByMonth.Year, SalesByMonth.Month


-- 2. Create a query for an invoicing report that lists all of a customerâ€™s orders (order #, date, subtotal, tax, freight, and total due), and has a running total of the total due field.
-- The query should split the orders by month/year  (ie, Jan 2020, Feb 2020, etc), and the running total should reset every time the customer and month/year changes.
-- The query should work for all customers. Customer 11566 April Shan is a good test case.

-- 3. Create a query that list each customer, the date of their first sale, the date of their most recent sale, and the total amount spent on all orders.
-- Include the details about the first and last orders on the same row (sales order number, totals, and shipped date). Use window functions for this

-- 6. Compare the executions plans of #'s 3, 4, & 5. How do they compare? Which query produces a plan that is more optimal? Why?

-- couldn't get any subqueries or cross applies to work so I have nothing to compare to the window functions
